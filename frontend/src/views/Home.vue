      <p>
        The original purpose of this website was to demonstrate useful instructions for the members of the IID laboratory to conduct simulations on our Linux servers.
        As time passes by, our group grows larger and I think it is necessary to re-design the UI and reposition this website.
        Now this website not only serves as the documentation site for our servers, but also presents other useful information like the timeline of some conferences, etc.

      <p>
        There are two servers (Dell Precision Workstation) of our laboratory residing in Room 305, 2nd Building of SIST, ShanghaiTech University.
        The two servers have been running stably and providing services for the laboratory members to conduct simulations since they were deployed in May, 2020.
